Brutal Audio - Very Old Python Version
Updated March 2018

- This project is a very old version of the Brutal Audio Application. It is being kept on the profile to illustrate my use of Python, and my improvement over time as a programmer.

- This version is notably different than the new 2018 version. The most obvious being that this was coded using Python, and TkInter. There are very few similarities between this and the new version, however, some of the processes may be similar.

- Just for fun :)
